# gartusy_cms
Homemade CMS in part time of my engineer formation. I principaly maked that CMS for educational purpose. A CMS project would always have too many things to do for a single guy, but I think that its structure could be used by beginners to understand webapplication structure.

The webapp actually have 6 modules, each one could be displayed in a page and having its own views :
- News
- News by subject
- Galery
- Contact form
- Text (including images and documents inside)
- Mixe of above content 

Create a DB using the db.sql file and put right parameters in /Web/constFile.php

The admin login is gartugozul and password is abcdef. 

If you're here and that you're trying it or use it, I would be glad to know :
